# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Raw data is in CSV file.  Using Excel, CSV file was filtered for Tennessee data only.  Then, using Python and Pandas, filtered dataset will be loaded into Jupyter Notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Cleaning.

## Database Storage
Once data is cleaned, tables will be created in PgAdmin for use with PostgreSQL to match the dataset.  Then, cleaned dataset will be imported.

## Machine Learning


## Dashboard
Once a general dashboard display layout is determined, the Dashboard will be created using Javascript to be displayed as an interactive webpage.  Depending on needs, CSS, D3, and Bootstrap components could be used to enhance the dashboard displays.
