\#\#\#\*\*Project description/outline\*\*: Based on a dataset from the national weather service, storm prediction center, we will analyze storm frequency and strength in the state of Tennessee between 1950 - 2013.

\#\#\#\*\*Research questions to answer\*\*: Have tornadoes increased in intensity in the last 50 years in the state of Tennessee? What counties are most likely to have more tornadoes? Has the frequency of tornadoes in Tennessee increased since 1950?

\#\#\#\*\*Data set to be used\*\*: data was obtained from data.world and represents tornado tracks from the United States, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. For this project we filtered the data for tornadoes in the state of Tennessee.
